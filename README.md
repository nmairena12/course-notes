# How to download course notes

You need to have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed on your computer. Make sure you are logged in to both the GitHub web site and the GitHub Desktop application.

1. On GitHub, Click the green 'Clone or Download' button within the 'course-notes' (this) repository. Next, click 'Open in Desktop'. You may receive an alert which asks you to 'Open in GitHub Desktop?' Click 'Open in GitHub Desktop' and tick the checkbox to remember your choice.

2. When prompted to save the repository, click 'Clone'. Note which directory on your computer you are saving the files to.


## How to update course notes

Once you have cloned 'course-notes' to your computer, when the repository has been updated:

1. Open the GitHub Desktop application.

2. Under the 'Current Repository' tab, select 'course-notes' (if it is not already selected).

3. Click the 'Fetch origin' tab. All updates (including new slides and corrections to old ones) will be downloaded to your computer.


## How to review your notes

Course notes are written in HTML (and CSS). This is to help you become familiar with the code you will be writing, in addition to learning the content contained within the notes themselves.

There are two ways you can review the notes:

1. As they are **formatted for the web**. You can open any file by dragging it to the Google Chrome icon on your dock. You can also open the files from within the browser by selecting "File", then "Open File" from the menu.

2. As **code**. Open the file by dragging it to the Atom icon on your dock. You can also open them from within Atom, by selecting "File", then "Open" from the menu. Having access to notes in this format gives you code to tinker with. The more code you see and play with, the more comfortable you should become.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I view the notes online? What is the URL for these notes?**

No.

I do not set up the notes as an Internet-accessible web site so you are forced to download them and play with the code. If the pages were easily accessible, no one would bother looking at what makes them work.

I want you get familiar with viewing code using a web browser and a text editor. See how the pages look in different browsers like Chrome, Safari or  Opera. Can you spot differences? Try making changes to the code.


**What if I break the code?**

I encourage you to break the code. You will learn more from breaking and fixing than doing everything perfect the first time. If you break the code, you can always revert to a "clean" copy.

To get a clean version of your notes, open GitHub Desktop. Select the "course-notes" repository. Next, right-click on the file you want to refresh. Select 'Discard Changes...' then click the 'Discard Changes' button. This will delete any changes you have made to the file.
